# Geo-Mapping-Challenge: Visualizing Data with Leaflet
<br>
In this challenge, I am visualizing earthquake data provided by the USGB (United States Geological Survey), which is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change.<br>

Required Files:<br>
* index.html<br>
* logic.js<br>
* config.js<br>
* style.css<br>
Note: `config.js` is excluded on GitHub as it contains API Key.<br>

Step 0: Getting the Data<br>

* The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and pick a data set to visualize. When you click on a data set, for example 'All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days', you will be given a JSON representation of that data. You will be using the URL of this JSON to pull in the data for our visualization.

Step 1: Getting the Data<br>


Step 2: Visualization<br>
* Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.
* Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.
* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.
* Your visualization should look something like the map above.
